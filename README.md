# Conclusion
### Based on the results of the simulation and comparison with the analytical solution, the following conclusions can be drawn:

```
Monte Carlo Integration Estimate: 2.6877
Analytical Result using quad Function: 2.6667
Deviation from Analytical Result: 0.02099
```
## Summary:
The Monte Carlo integration estimate is reasonably close to the analytical result obtained using the quad function.

The deviation from the analytical result is small (approximately 0.02), indicating the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method in this specific case.

The accuracy of the Monte Carlo results could be further improved by increasing the number of random points in the simulation.

Overall, the Monte Carlo method proves effective in estimating the integral value for the given function, and the obtained results are quite close to those achievable analytically.
